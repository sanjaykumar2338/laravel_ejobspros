            <h4>Lead Form Integration</h4>
            <p>A website visitor should be funneled via the landing page to complete a quick and straightforward form to subscribe to a newsletter, contact your sales team, sign up for a demo,download a guidebook, or sign up to win something. The goal of the CRM is to obtain email addresses and names.<p>

            <h4>Filter Of Customers</h4>
            <p>Segment your customers and prospects based on industry, value, date of the last contact, and geographic location. Such crucial information helps you to target marketing messages to capture the buyer’s attention effectively.<p>

            <h4>Automated Email</h4>
            <p>An automated CRM creates an organized email list, sends out follow-up emails, and sends communications to push the potential buyer based on where the prospect is within the entire buying process, such as if they have abandoned a cart.<p>

            <h4>Visibility and Tracking</h4>
            <p>You want to generate the most significant amount of revenue for your business – it’s all about the bottom line. An automated CRM lets you track leads that span from source to sale so you can understand the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.<p>
        	<p>Many CRMs do not provide this out of the box, but you can have it as an integration or add-on. It is a definite must-have to stay up-to-date on the revenue impact of your marketing campaigns.</p>

            <h4>Market Automation and Lead Nurturing</h4>
            <p>Building solid connections and relationships with your customers requires more than a single sale if you want to create stable connections with your customers.
