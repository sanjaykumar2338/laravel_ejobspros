            <h3>The most effective mobile marketing strategies for eCommerce consist of</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mobile-Friendly Content</li>
                <li>Voice Search Optimization</li>
                <li>Text Message Marketing</li>
                <li>Videos</li>
                <li>Mobile Apps</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Mobile-Friendly Content</h3>
            <p>Your web pages are a crucial resource for your eCommerce business. You want to ensure that the content on your website is mobile-friendly. Every aspect of your website from the landing page to the online store’s checkout should function via a mobile device. You want mobile users to have a robust and satisfying experience. Not to mention, mobile-friendliness helps with search engine ranking. The website should load quickly and be responsive to highlight your products across a wide array of platforms with ease.</p>
            <h3>Voice Search Optimization</h3>
            <p>Smartphone users often use voice search instead of typing in phrases. Optimizing your web pages for voice search is quickly becoming a ‘must.’ Everything is tailored using long-tail phrases that people frequently say into their phones when searching.</p>
            <h3>Text Message Marketing</h3>
            <p>Text messaging marketing is a terrific way to reach smartphone users with sales or other deals. Marketing texts are a very personal way to connect. You should always try to personalize the text and keep it short. Provide real value so the recipient will look forward to your business texts and not end up blocking or unsubscribing.</p>
            <h3>Videos</h3>
            <p>Mobile users are hungry for videos. Marketing videos are a highly effective way to push purchase decisions. Many people remember information presented in a video better than something they visually read. One study shows that 85 percent of millennials have actually made a purchase after watching a mobile marketing video.</p>
            <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
            <p>Developing your own mobile app appears to have a significant impact on customers. They are great to spur interest in your eCommerce site, influence purchasing decisions, and drive traffic.</p>
