            <h3>What is Paid Search advertising</h3>
            <p>Paid search advertising is a frequent marketing tactic that involves paying search engines for ad placements on SERPs.</p>

            <p><b>Youâ€™ll encounter six factors that determine the placement of Google ads:</b></p>

            <p><strong>Bids:</strong> You work within an auction structure where businesses bid on keywords or particular key phrases that are target-specific and geared towards their products and services. The ads work on what is referred to as a pay-per-click (PPC) basis. They are cost-effective because you only pay for the ad if it is clicked upon.</p>

            <p><strong>Ad and landing page quality:</strong> Google regularly assesses the relevance of landing pages based on their usefulness. Factors like mobile-friendliness, website performance, and more are evaluated. Google then assigns a Quality Score for ads.</p>

            <p><strong>Keyword popularity:</strong> When two ads have the same ranking then the one with the highest bid always wins.</p>

            <p><strong>Ad thresholds:</strong> Things like ad quality, user signals, ad position, and other attributes like the nature of the search or the topic are all factored in and related to the auctions.</p>

            <p><strong>Context of search:</strong> The location, search term, device type, ad competition, search results, and nature of search are considered.</p>

            <p><strong>Ad extension impact:</strong> Businesses are given the option of including phone numbers and links.</p>
